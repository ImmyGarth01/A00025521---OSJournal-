## Project Overview – Operating Systems Coursework ##

### Assessment Aim ###

This coursework encouraged me to discuss deployment, security hardening, and performance evaluation of a headless Linux Ubnuntu server. The primary objective is to demonstrate my O.S administration skills, with a strong focus command-line configuration, security implementation, and system performance analysis.

All administrative tasks were carried out remotely using secure shell (SSH), which is reflective of a real world scenario in which this could be in pracitice.

### System Architecture ###

The system is designed using a dual-machine architecture. A headless Ubuntu Server used as the testing system, whilst I used my host laptop/ worksation as an administrator. The server does not have a graphical user interface and is managed  through command-line tools accessed via SSH. This means that I am demonstrating my ability to implement remote access administration


### Technologies Used ###

Ubuntu Server (Linux)

OpenSSH

UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)

stress-ng

fio

iperf3

nginx

sysstat

GitHub Pages

### Assessment Phases Overview ###
Here is a breaking down of the following pages:


#### Phase 1 – System Planning & Distribution Selection ####

This phase focused on planning my operating system deployment and justifying my technical decisions.

#### Phase 2 – Security Planning & Testing Methodology ####

Here I designed my security baseline and performance testing methodology.

#### Phase 3 – Application Selection for Performance Testing ####

Selected applications representing different workload types for performance evaluation.

#### Phase 4 – Initial System Configuration & Security Implementation ####

Deployed my server and implemented foundational security controls.

#### Phase 5 – Advanced Security and Monitoring Infrastructure ####

Implemented advanced security controls and develop monitoring capabilities.

#### Phase 6 – Performance Evaluation and Analysis  ####

Executed detailed performance testing and analysed operating system behaviour under different workloads.

#### Phase 7 – Security Audit and System Evaluation ####

Conducted a security audit and evaluated overall system configuration.

### Evidence and Assessment Approach ###

Evidence throughout this journal is presented through  screenshots, command-line outputs, and reflective commentary. A recorded demonstration video accompanies this journal to validate system configuration, security controls, and performance testing activities.

### Learning Outcomes ###

This project has developed practical skills in Linux server administration, secure remote access, firewall configuration, performance monitoring, and critical analysis of operating system behaviour under different workloads.
