# Phase 2 – Secruity Planning and Testing Methodology 

## Objectives
Design a security baseline and performance testing methodology
---

## 1. Performance Testing plan 

**Remote Monitoring Methodology:**  
As a part of the project dual system requirement, the Ubunutu servers will be monitored remotely throught the workstation (my laptop) via the SSH (Safe shell)
This will be done utilising the Command Line terminal in which certain commands can be used to monitor different aspects of the system such as its storage and processing usuage. 

Examples include:

top / htop → CPU and process monitoring

free -h → RAM usage

df -h → disk usage

ip addr → network interface and IP status

**Testing Approach:**
