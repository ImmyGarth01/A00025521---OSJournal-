## 1. Security Audit Report


### a. Running the Baseline Security Audit (Lynis)

Firstly in order to understand what changes I could make to the security of my system I ran a Lynis Security audit, I did this before so I could see its suggestions and warnings and also get a hardening score, so I can compare my system after the changes and see if it has increased, showing an increase in the system's overall efficiency
