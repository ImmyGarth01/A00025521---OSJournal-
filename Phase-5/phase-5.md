## 1. Implement Access Control using SELinux or AppArmor , with documentation showing how to track and report on access control settings 

In this case, as i'm operating an ubunut server my MAC will be AppArmor. 

### a. Confirming App Armour is Installed 

This shows how I have the MAC installed on my server, evidencing that it exists to track and report on access control settings


### b. Confirming App Armour is running 

This shows that App Armour is not only installed but actively running

### c. Presenting loaded App Armour profiles 

This shows which profiles are currently being tracked and reported on in the access control setting 

### d. Demonstrating the Profiles being enforced 

The enforcement status of AppArmor profiles was reported, confirming that profiles are actively enforced rather than operating in complain mode
