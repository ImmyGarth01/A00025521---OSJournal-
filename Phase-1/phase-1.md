# Phase 1 – System Planning and Distribution Selection

## Objectives
The purpose of this phase is to plan my operating system deployment and justify technical decisions 
---

## 1. System Architecture
In my diagram below I am presenting my Host-Only Network setup which uses Virtual Box. As displayed, my personal workstation, the host laptop, has a direct connection to the Ubuntu Linux Server which is running as a virtual machine. The host and VM are connected by the SHH (Secure Shell) which allows for secure communication. As highlted before this is all done on Virtual Box's shared private network.

## 2. Distribution Selection Justification 
Within this project I have decided to use an Ubuntu Server as my virtual machine. This is because I believe it is best suited to the learning test environment necessary to show the required skills in command-line proficiency and system configuration, security implementation, and performance analysis as specified in the assessment brief.

## 3. Workstation Configuration Decision 

## 4. Network Configuration Documenation 

## 5. CLI Specifications Documentation
