# Phase 1 – System Planning and Distribution Selection

## Objectives
The purpose of this phase is to plan my operating system deployment and justify technical decisions

## 1. System Architecture
In my diagram below I am presenting my Host-Only Network setup which uses Virtual Box. As displayed, my personal workstation, the host laptop, has a direct connection to the Ubuntu Linux Server which is running as a virtual machine. The host and VM are connected by the SHH (Secure Shell) which allows for secure communication. As highlted before this is all done on Virtual Box's shared priavte network.
