# Phase 1 – System Planning and Distribution Selection

## Objectives
The purpose of this phase is to plan the system architecture, select appropriate Linux distributions, and document the initial system specifications for the server and workstation environment.

---

## System Architecture
The system consists of a host workstation (your laptop) and an Ubuntu Server virtual machine running in VirtualBox. The workstation connects to the server via SSH over a host-only network. This setup provides isolated communication suitable for a secure lab environment.
